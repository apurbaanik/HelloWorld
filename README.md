# HelloWorld
Lab #1 Setup

In this Lab #1, I will be setting up GitHub and get familiar with submitting labs in my Data Structure Course. This repository contains a README file, source Code for HelloWorld in Java, and a task list for the bonus part in the issues tab. Also, I used the issue tracker on the GitHub repo and responded to issues in my commit messages.

When I was uploading the code in GitHub, I was having an issue to push it to the origin. The reason was I didn't have a recent copy of the repository in my local system. So I cloned the program to my local computer, and then I was able to push it to GitHub.
