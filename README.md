# HelloWorld
Lab #1 Setup

In this Lab #1, we will be setting up github and get fimiliar with submitting labs in this Data Structure Course. This repository contains a README file, source Code for HelloWorld in Java, and a task list for the bonus part in the issues tab. 

When I was uploading the code in github, I was having issue to push it to the origin. The reason was I didn't had the recent copy of the repository in my local system. So I cloned the program to my local computer, and then I was able to push it to github.
